We did this project to demonstrate our knowledge of HTML and CSS. These past couple of months we have learned basic HTML and CSS, and now we have to show our abilities by recreating a website of our choice. I decided to recreate the Apple website. For me it was quite difficult beacuse I didn't remember how to properly use div elements, so I didn’t really know where to begin from. However, after reviewing my notes and going to websites like https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/ and https://www.w3schools.com/, I remembered the basic things I needed to help me get started. As I recreated my website, something I was really stuck on was portraying the  apple logo on the top left corner and the search and shopping bag logo on the top right corner located at the top of the apple website. I looked at a variety of examples, but I just wasn’t able to get it to work. I was able to achieve my MVP (Minimum viable product) which I wasn’t too upset with because it had the main content. Next time, I will try to manage my time better so that I won't feel rushed as I get closer to the deadline.
